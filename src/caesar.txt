    If the shift value isn't present, equal to 0, less than -25, or greater than 25, the function should return false.  - check at the start

    Spaces should be maintained throughout, as should other nonalphabetic symbols. - how to keep spaces???
    Capital letters can be ignored. - use toLowerCase

    If a letter is shifted so that it goes "off" the alphabet (e.g., a shift of 3 on the letter z), it should wrap around to the front of the alphabet (e.g., z becomes c). - use mod26

      // Get the letter's code
      var code = str.charCodeAt(i) - to get each characters ASCII value


    TESTS:
    1. returns false if shift is equal to 0, >25, <-25, or !shift
    2. returns cipher text with given shift
    3. check if input is present
